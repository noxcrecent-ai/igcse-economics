Why it should not: demand for perfume may be elastic and so may not raise much revenue. In contrast, inelastic demand for food so may raise high tax revenue perfume may be an important domestic industry.

The out the possible decisions and outcomes. It is also possible that unskilled workers could be higher paid. This is because their work may be dangerous, e.g. miners, so the supply of workers willing to do the job may be lower and firms have to pay more to attract workers. Long working hours (less leisure time) and poor working conditions mean unskilled workers may be higher paid, and if the work is boring and very few people are willing to do the job. For example, cleaners in the US are paid much higher wages than cleaners in India as the number of people willing to accept a job as a cleaner in the US is very low.

If there is market failure caused by a demerit good it will be because too many people are consuming them and causing total benefit for society to fall. Reward but do not expect provision of information. Government intervention such as increasing taxes for merit goods will lower consumption and also with the money collected from taxes they can make merit goods instead of demerit goods. For example, if too many people consume cigarettes and tobacco, the government can raise taxes for tobacco and prices will rise. They can use the taxes collected to make additional videos and tell people the bad things that comes from smoking. Therefore, people will consume less of these demerit goods. However, demerit goods especially addictive things like cigarettes will have a lot of people producing them since its easy to make money.

        "markScheme": "Why it might be an advantage Certainty - with a fixed exchange rate, firms will always know the exchange rate and this makes trade and investment less risky. Absence of speculation - with a fixed exchange rate, there will be no speculation if people believe that the rate will stay fixed with no revaluation or devaluation. Constraint on government policy - if the exchange rate is fixed, then the government may be unable to pursue extreme or irresponsible macroeconomic policies as these would cause a run on the foreign exchange reserves and this would be unsustainable in the medium-term. Keep inflation low. Firms have an incentive to keep cutting costs to remain competitive. Governments who allow their exchange rate to depreciate may cause inflationary pressures to occur. Depreciation can cause inflation because total demand increases, import prices increase and firms have less incentive to cut costs. Maintain competitiveness - a fixed exchange rate can ensure that exports remain price competitive. A rapid appreciation in a floating exchange rate system will badly affect manufacturing firms who export; this may also cause a worsening of the current account. Why it might be a disadvantage The economy may be unable to respond to shocks - a fixed exchange rate means that there may be no mechanism for the government to respond rapidly to balance of payments crises. Problems with reserves - fixed exchange rate systems require large foreign exchange reserves and there can be international liquidity problems as a result.

October/ Speculation \u2013 if foreign exchange markets believe that there may be a revaluation or devaluation, then there may be a run of speculation. Fighting this may cost the government significantly in terms of their foreign exchange reserves. Policy conflicts - the fixed exchange rate may not be compatible with other economic targets for growth, inflation and unemployment and this may cause conflicts of policies. This is especially true if the exchange rate is fixed at a level that is either too high or too low. makes use of economic information and clear analysis to evaluate economic issues and situations.
